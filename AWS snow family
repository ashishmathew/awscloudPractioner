Portable devices to collect and process data at the edge and migrate it in and out of the cloud
Data Migration : 
-Snowcone (small 4.5 pounds, 2.1Kg)
  - used for edge computing
  - 8TB
  - Snowcone SSD
   - 14TB
  - own battery/cables
  -sent to AWS offline or connect to internet via AWS data sync

-SnowBall Edge (large dc migrations, dc decommision, DR) - used for edge computing
 - TB or PB in and out of AWS
 - Storage optimized
  - 80 TB
 - Compute optimized 
  - 42 TB or 28TB

---above both can run ec2 and aws lambda functions (using AW IOT greengrass)
--long term deployment options - `1 to 3 years

-SnowMobile
 - truck
 - 1EB = 1000  PB = 1, 000, 000 TBs.
 - 1 truck = 100 PB

Edge computing: 
- Snowcone
- Snowball Edge

---OPSHUB(cli or UI) need to be installed in the servers to transfer data to snow family
---data loaded to s3

--Snowball edge pricing
 - not to pay for data into aws
 - 10 days usage for storage optimized - 80TB
 - 15 days usage for storage optimized - 120 TB
 - if you commit upfront montly, 1 yr to 3 yr(edge computing) - 62% discount

 AWS storage gateway
 - allows you to bridge between on premise data and cloud data in s3 (Hybrid setting)
