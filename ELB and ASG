###High availablity  - running apps on 2 AZs
###Scalability vs Elasticity vs Agility
Scalable - scale in or scale out 
Elastic - once scaled, - implement automatic scaling
Agile - iterate more quickly (This can be a distractor in the exam)

###load balancing
Provide ssl termination (https) for your websites

###ELB
AWS will provide maintenance, upgrades and high availability 
AWS and user will have to share configuration management since AWS only provides few config knobs

###Kinds of load balancer
- App LB - layer 7 (http, https) - static DNS
- Network L/B - layer 4 - (ultra high performance, tcp/udp) (Static Ip through Elastic IP)
- Gateway LB - layer 3 
- Classic LB - retired (2023) - layer 4 and 7
