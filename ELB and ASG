###High availablity  - running apps on 2 AZs
###Scalability vs Elasticity vs Agility
Scalable - scale in or scale out 
Elastic - once scaled, - implement automatic scaling
Agile - iterate more quickly (This can be a distractor in the exam)

###load balancing
Provide ssl termination (https) for your websites

###ELB (can be in multiple AZ)
AWS will provide maintenance, upgrades and high availability 
AWS and user will have to share configuration management since AWS only provides few config knobs

###Kinds of load balancer
- App LB - layer 7 (http, https,grpc) - static DNS
- Network L/B - layer 4 - (ultra high performance - millions of requsts per second, tcp/udp/tls) (Static Ip through Elastic IP)
- Gateway LB - layer 3 (protocol - GENEVE - route traffics to firewalls for intrusion detection)
- Classic LB - retired (2023) - layer 4 and 7 

###ASG - auto scaling Group (savings guaranteed)
--minimum, desired capacity, maximum capacity

Manual Scaling - update manually
Dynamic Scaling  -  
 - Simple/Step Scaling
  - cloud watch alarms triggered (e.g. CPU > 70%)
 - Target tracking scaling (e.g. ASG cpu stay at 40%)
 - Scheduled scaling (usage patterns)
 - Predicitive scaling
