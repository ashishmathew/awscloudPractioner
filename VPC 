IP4 address
 - public  (charged)
 -private

Elastic - stop and start wont affect the instance IP
IPv6 (free in AWS)

(**Keep the diagrams in mind from the slides)
VPC and Subnets Primer
 - linked to a specific region
- VPC has subnets (public and private, outside world can access the public subnet but not the private, they can communicate via route tables)


Internet Gateway and Nat Gateway
 - Internet GW
  - public subnet acceses the internet via Internet GW
 
 - Nat Gateway
  - somtimes private subnet need access to the intenet while remaining private
  - so nat geteway in place in public subnet and private subnet access nat gateway which in turn accesses the internet

  route tables - > 
   - it will have the routes for local path and paths to the internet


Network ACL and Security Groups 
 -NACL 
  - they are on the subnet level 
  - they allow and deny access
  - rules include only IP address
  - stateless - return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules

- Security groups (at the Ec2 instance level)
 - they only allow access for IP and other security groups
 - stateful -  return traffic is automatically allowed regardless of rules

 VPC Flow Logs
  - Captures information about IP traffic through the interfaces
   - VPC
   - Subnet
   - Elastic Network Interface
  - Captures n/w information from AWS managed interfaces too - ELB, Elasticache, RDS etc. 
  - logs can go s3, cloudwatch logs and Kinesis data fireshose
 
 VPC Peering
  - connect two vpc using aws network
  - must not have overlapping CIDR (IP address range)
  - connection is not transitive

VPC Endpoints
 - connect to services using a private n/w
 - vpc endpoint type : gateway  : S3 & dynamo DB
- vpc endpoint type : interface : the rest

PrivateLink 
 - if a 3rd party within aws wants to access your app within aws
  - requires a n/w load balancer(service VPC) and elastic n/w interface(ENI) (Customer VPC)
  - then create a private link between the above two

Hybrid cloud 
 - Site to Site VPN (public) 
  - connects on prem to aws cloud over the internet
  - on prem - customer gateway (CGW)
  - aws : Virtual private gateway(VGW)

 - Direct Connect (private) - physically connects on prem to aws cloud


 AWS client VPN (same like Lumen n/w)

 Transit gateway : (hub and spoke)
  - transitive peering between thousands of vpc and on prem
