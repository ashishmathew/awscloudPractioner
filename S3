###buckets (region level)
-infinitely scaling storage
-Used for integration with other AWS services
buckets : directories  (globally unique name across all regions all accounts
)
objects : files
Naming convention for buckets - must start with a lower caser letter or number
no suffix or prefix
-objects have a key - which is the full path (absolute path)
 - there are no concepts of directories    

- max object size is 5TB (5000 GB)
- if > 5GB , use 'multi part upload' 
- it will have metada, tags and version id

--public url vs presigned url (user key encoded)

- #### Security
-user based - through IAM policies
- Resource based - 
 - Bucket policies -bucketwide rules for cross account  
 - Object access control list (ACL) - can be disabled (fine grain)
 - Bucket access control list (less)
- we can encrypt objects as well
- by default public access is blocked for all buckets 

-S3 Static website hosting (format - bucket- region - website name)
-S3 versioning (enabled at the bucket level)
-S3 replication (replication only works with versioning*** i..e if versioning is enabled) - You can aslo replicate previous objects through batch operations
 - CRR - Cross region replication
-  SRR - Same region replication

### S3 Storage classes
Durability - i.e how many objects can get lost (11 9s)
Availabiity - i.e. 99.99% (53 minutes downtime)

-------- Standard General purpose
 - 99.99% availability, low latency, high throughput, sustain 2 concurrent facility failures
 - big data analytics, mobile and gaming applications

-------- InFrequent access
 - 99.9% avaialable, rapid access when needed though, lower cost than S3 standard
  S3 Standard IA- back up and DR  (30 days)
  S3 One Zone Infrequent access - 99.5% available in a single AZ, lost when AZ is destroyed (30 days)
   -store on premise data or data that needs to be recreated  

------Glacier storage classes --- 
-low cost object storage for archive and backup
- pricing - storage  + retrieval

-Instant retrieval - milliseconds,(e.g. data accesses once a quarter) min storage - 90 days
-Flexible retrieval (expedited: 1 - 5 mins, standard: 3-5 hours, Bulk : 5 -12 hours) - min storage - 90 days 
-Deep archive - Standard(12 hours), bulk (48 hours) - 180 days

---------S3 Intelligent tiering
- small monthly fee
-moves objects between tiers based on usage
- no retrieval charges
types
 - frequent access tier - auto - default
 - Infrequent access tier - auto -  ( 30 days)
 - Archive instant access tier -  - auto - (90 days)
 - archive access tier (optional) - 90 - 700+
 - Deep archive access tier (180 - 700+)
