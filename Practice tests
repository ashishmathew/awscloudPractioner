Practice test 1 
    - AWS trusted advisor - real time guidance on fault tolerance, cost optimization, security
    - before sending data into s3 , you can have encrypt the data using aws sdk and then send it into s3 this is client side encryption. 
    - network address translation gateway is managed by aws and network  address translation instance is managed by user
    - need to review support plans - basic, developer, business, enterprise, enterprise on ramp
    - cloud trail - used for logging and compliance
    - cloud watch - use of monitoring and performance of resources. 
    - vpc endpoint gateway type - s3 and dynamo db
    - vpc endpoint interface type - rest (amazon s3 supports it as well)
    - aws site to site vpn uses public internet
    - aws compute optimizer - find optimal resources for cost optimization. It uses machine learning (ec2 , EBS , AWS lambda, ec2 auto scaling groups)
    - AWS Systems Manager - track operational issues, automate operational tasks
    - CAF common stake holders - CTO, Tech leaderss, engineers, architects
    - Code artifact - same as nexus
    - AWS artifact  - HIPAA, BAA compliance, agreement
    - Advanced shield - route 53, global accelerator, ec2, elb, cloudfront
    - encryption - cloudtrail by default along with s3
    - review services for well architected framework


Practice test 2
    - OpsWorks - anything to do with Chef and Puppet
    - WAF - allow and deny on layer 7 - (e.g. gaming content, sql injection etc )
    - Neptune - Social network
    - DynamoDB - key value - used to recommendations with least operational overhead
    - Guardduty - uses ml to find threats
    - VPC spans across all availability zones and subnet spans only one AZ
    - Check out CAF - the diagram and if possible meemorize it. 
    - ECR - store, manage and deploy Docker container images
    - ECS - run Docker containers
    - AWS Storage Gateway - tape, volume and file gateway
    - EventBridge - used to schedule jobs - serverless
    - Step functions - create serverless visual workflows
    - Read differences between multi - az , multi region and read replica deployments (45th question)
    - Read CAF transormational phases
    - Elastic beanstalk - upload code and rest is handled by beanstalk - provisioning resources etc. user has access to underlying resources


Practice test 3
AWS trusted advisor - 6 ? ???CPSFSO
What is Amazon comprehend vs kendra? NLP vs doc search and insights 
Cloud foundations - guided path to provision resources
High availability - Dynamo DB, EFS
Instance store - also used for caching
Block level storage - EBS, Instace store

Practice test 4
What data does S3 store ?  object storage - key value, flat non hierarchical structure
Trusted advisor barks when - public access to S3, not turning on user activity logging(cloudtrail), 
    not using MFA on root account
you can access EFA from on premise systems
Advanced shield provides secutity to - ec2, cloudfront, route 53, ELB, AWS Global accelerator

Web application firewall (WAF)
 - allow and deny requests, sql injection
 AWS cloudwatch events - you can set alerts

 RDS 
  - read replicas and multi az deployments - you can use both for disaster recovery

AWS global accelerator 
 - static Ip address that acts as entrypoint
 - good fit for non-http use cases

Simple routing - single resource like a web server

AWS trusted advisor - if any EBS vol is underutilized, it will let you know
