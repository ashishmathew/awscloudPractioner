Practice test 1 
    - AWS trusted advisor - real time guidance on fault tolerance, cost optimization, security
    - before sending data into s3 , you can have encrypt the data using aws sdk and then send it into s3 this is client side encryption. 
    - network address translation gateway is managed by aws and network  address translation instance is managed by user
    - need to review support plans - basic, developer, business, enterprise, enterprise on ramp
    - cloud trail - used for logging and compliance
    - cloud watch - use of monitoring and performance of resources. 
    - vpc endpoint gateway type - s3 and dynamo db
    - vpc endpoint interface type - rest (amazon s3 supports it as well)
    - aws site to site vpn uses public internet
    - aws compute optimizer - find optimal resources for cost optimization. It uses machine learning (ec2 , EBS , AWS lambda, ec2 auto scaling groups)
    - AWS Systems Manager - track operational issues, automate operational tasks
    - CAF common stake holders - CTO, Tech leaderss, engineers, architects
    - Code artifact - same as nexus
    - AWS artifact  - HIPAA, BAA compliance, agreement
    - Advanced shield - route 53, global accelerator, ec2, elb, cloudfront
    - encryption - cloudtrail by default along with s3
    - review services for well architected framework


Practice test 2
    - OpsWorks - anything to do with Chef and Puppet
    - WAF - allow and deny on layer 7 - (e.g. gaming content, sql injection etc )
    - Neptune - Social network
    - DynamoDB - key value - used to recommendations with least operational overhead
    - Guardduty - uses ml to find threats
    - VPC spans across all availability zones and subnet spans only one AZ
    - Check out CAF - the diagram and if possible meemorize it. 
    - ECR - store, manage and deploy Docker container images
    - ECS - run Docker containers
    - AWS Storage Gateway - tape, volume and file gateway
    - EventBridge - used to schedule jobs - serverless
    - Step functions - create serverless visual workflows
    - Read differences between multi - az , multi region and read replica deployments (45th question)
    - Read CAF transormational phases
    - Elastic beanstalk - upload code and rest is handled by beanstalk - provisioning resources etc. user has access to underlying resources
